### BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS

#### PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS UPDATES
A Translational Breast Cancer Research review highlighted critical updates in **breast cancer pathologic diagnosis** impacting clinical practice in 2023 and 2024. These updates are especially relevant to **invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), phyllodes tumors, new IHC indexes, neoadjuvant therapy updates, and advancements in HER2-low breast cancer**. The review encompassed a comprehensive search of PubMed, Baidu Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and academic conferences as of April 2024.

#### AI IN BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS
**AI is increasingly integral in improving breast cancer detection and diagnosis.** *Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy* published a review in February 2025, emphasizing the importance of optimal diagnosis and treatment models tailored to individual patient risk and subtypes. This includes the potential for AI to personalize treatment strategies based on a deeper understanding of each patient's unique cancer profile.

#### PHYLLODES TUMORS
Developments in understanding and diagnosing malignant phyllodes tumors (MPTs) are significant:
- **Tumor Microenvironment:** A study presented at the 2023 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium revealed heightened immune infiltration of B cells, M2 macrophages, and neutrophil cells in the tumor microenvironment of primary MPTs and lung metastases. Specific gene mutations, such as TERT promoter, MED12, and RB1 alterations, were identified in lung metastases.
- **Revised Diagnostic Criteria:** Revised criteria for diagnosing MPTs, presented at the 2024 USCAP meeting, demonstrated improved predictive accuracy. Metastases occurred in 35.7% of 140 MPT patients when using the revised criteria, compared to none of the borderline phyllodes tumors (BPT) patients. This suggests the revised criteria are superior to the WHO criteria in predicting clinical outcomes.

#### THERAPEUTIC ADVANCEMENTS
New treatment options are improving patient outcomes:
- **Oral Medications and Immunotherapy:** According to an expert from Ochsner Health System in January 2025, new oral medications, such as CDK4/6 inhibitors for metastatic breast cancer, and immunotherapy with pembrolizumab for triple-negative breast cancer in the adjuvant setting, are enhancing patient outcomes and reducing the frequency of required appointments.

#### PROGNOSTIC STAGING
**Mayo Clinic** began using **prognostic breast cancer staging** in the United States in 2018, incorporating cancer grade, hormone receptor status, HER2 status, and gene expression. Clinical prognostic staging is done before treatment, while pathological prognostic staging is performed post-surgery.

#### DIAGNOSTIC VOLUME
Sheba Medical Center reports treating over 4,000 breast cancer patients annually, performing approximately 12,000 mammograms, 51,000 ultrasounds, 3,200 MRIs, and 2,500 biopsies. This reflects the high volume of diagnostic and treatment activity in a major medical center.

#### EARLY-STAGE PROGNOSIS
**Stage 0 breast cancer**, including Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), accounts for about 20% of all breast cancers. It is characterized by abnormal cells limited to the tissues lining the breast duct and has an excellent prognosis.

#### SURVIVAL RATES
According to the National Cancer Institute SEER Program, **99% of patients with breast cancers confined to the breast at diagnosis are alive at least five years later**, underscoring the importance of early detection.

#### TREATMENT OPTIONS
OncoLink indicates that treatment for early/moderate stage breast cancer (Stages 0, I, and II) may include **surgery** (lymph node removal/testing, breast-conserving surgery (BCS), mastectomy), **chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and participation in clinical trials.**

#### DIGITAL BREAST TOMOSYNTHESIS (DBT)
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** A study published in the *Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health* in May 2024 found that in Taiwan's National Health Insurance program, **DBT-MG has an ICER of US$5971.5764/QALY compared to MG alone**, far lower than the willingness-to-pay threshold of US$33,004 (Taiwan's GDP in 2021) per QALY. Over 98% of probabilistic simulations favored DBT-MG.
- **Cost Savings:** A study in Brazil (published Jan 2024) found that switching from DM to biennial DBT + s2D for women aged 40–69 years with scattered areas of fibroglandular breast density and heterogeneous dense breasts resulted in **cost savings of € 954.02 per patient over 30 years and gained 5.1989 QALYs**, thus being cost-effective.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** The Taiwan study's one-way sensitivity analysis indicated that the ICER of DBT-MG versus MG is heavily influenced by recall rates, biopsy rates, and positive predictive value (PPV2).
- **Meta-Analysis Results:** The Brazilian study's meta-analysis revealed that DBT + 2Ds had a detection cancer rate (DCR) of 1.35 (RR, p < 0.001), a detection invasive cancer rate (DICR) of 1.48 (RR, p < 0.001), a recall rate of 0.81 (RR, p = 0.028), and a biopsy rate (BR) of 0.89 (RR, p = 0.303) when compared with DM.
- **Markov Model Analysis:** The Taiwan study, using a Markov decision model with 10,000 simulations, a 2-year cycle length, and a 30-year time horizon, found that **DBT-MG, despite a higher initial cost ($177.81 vs $171.39 for MG), may reduce recall costs and aids in detecting more early-stage breast cancers**, resulting in superior cost-effectiveness.

#### LIQUID BIOPSIES
- **Advantages:** A review article published in *Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy* on December 2, 2024, highlights that **liquid biopsy**, encompassing CTCs, ctDNA, exosomes, microRNA, and other components, offers advantages over tissue biopsy for cancer diagnosis and treatment due to its **non-invasive nature**.
- **Clinical Trial Outcomes:** A study in the *Journal of Managed Care & Specialty Pharmacy* in July 2024, analyzing a real-world clinical genomic database, found that NSCLC patients enrolled in clinical trials following liquid biopsy CGP (using Guardant360) had significantly better overall survival (log-rank P < 0.0001) without increased costs of care.
- **Sensitivity and Specificity Requirements:** A *Communications Medicine* article published May 10, 2025, emphasizes the need for exceptionally **high sensitivity (66.3%) and specificity (98.4%)** for liquid biopsy assays in early cancer detection programs to avoid false negatives and confounding factors like CHIP.
- **Market Growth:** The global lung cancer liquid biopsy market was valued at an estimated USD 966.5 million in 2023 and is projected to grow at a **CAGR of 13.3% from 2024 to 2030**, driven by the rising prevalence of lung cancer and advancements in technology such as multi-gene parallel analysis (NGS).
- **Serum Breast Milk:** Research published in *Cancer Discovery* in 2023 indicates that **serum breast milk (sBM)** may be a superior source for liquid biopsy in early-stage pregnancy-related breast cancer (PrBC) detection, as ctDNA variants in sBM mirrored those in tumors and were detectable up to 18 months before diagnosis.

### LUNG CANCER DIAGNOSIS

#### IMPORTANCE OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS
A 2021 study in *Aging* highlights the significance of early lung cancer diagnosis, noting that **stage IA lung cancer has a 5-year survival rate exceeding 90%**, while stage IV has a rate less than 10%, emphasizing the crucial role of early diagnosis.

#### LOW-DOSE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (LDCT) SCREENING
- **Effectiveness:** The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that **low-dose CT (LDCT) screening reduces lung cancer mortality by 20.0%** compared to chest x-ray screening. However, LDCT has a false positive rate (FPR) of 23.3%.
- **Volume-Based LDCT:** A 2025 study in *PLoS One* found that annual lung cancer screening (LCS) with volume-based low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in Greece detected 17,104 more early-stage lung cancer patients out of 207,885 screened, averting 8,761 premature deaths, and resulting in an **ICER of €3,236 per LY and €5,505 per QALY**.
- **Integration and AI:** A February 2025 article in *Translational Lung Cancer Research* advocates learning from chronic disease screening programs and integrating AI to improve lung cancer detection rates and achieve universal access to screening.
- **Mobile LDCT with AI:** A February 2025 *BMC Cancer* study in rural Fujian Province, China, found that **mobile LDCT with AI (InferRead CT Lung Research)** for LCS in underserved populations had detection rates of 1.06% for suspected lung cancer (n=108) and 0.7% for confirmed cases (n=71) at an average cost of ¥118.47 (US$18.65) per screening and EDCI of 0.09 and 0.13 respectively.
- **Cost-Saving Analysis:** An August 2024 study in the *World Journal of Oncology* using a Markov model found that **LDCT screening in Taiwan is cost-saving compared to CXR**, with an ICUR of $-24,757.65/QALYs and 100% probability of being adopted under a WTP threshold of Taiwan's GDP per capita ($35,513).

#### LOW DIAGNOSIS RATE AT EARLY STAGE
LUNGevity Foundation, updated on February 12, 2024, indicates that only **21% of lung cancers are diagnosed at stage I**, highlighting the need for improved early detection strategies.

#### AI-DRIVEN LUNG CANCER SCREENING
- **Sensitivity and False Positives:** A review published in *Life (Basel)* on March 19, 2025, highlights that **AI-driven lung cancer screening can achieve over 90% sensitivity**, compared to 70-80% with traditional methods, and reduce false positives by up to 30%.
- **AI vs. Manual Interpretation:** A study in *Thoracic Cancer* (2024) analyzing 23,336 patients at West China Hospital showed **AI-assisted readings outperformed manual interpretation** in low-dose CT lung cancer screening, with a higher screening positive rate and an increased likelihood of diagnosing malignant nodules (p < 0.001). The AI group demonstrated a superior detection rate for malignant pulmonary nodules (97.2% vs. 86.4%, p < 0.001).
- **Multimodal Data Analysis:** An article posted on *MedImaging International* on March 28, 2025, discusses an **AI model developed by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)** that improves lung cancer risk prediction by 20% and cardiovascular risk prediction by 10% using multimodal data from CT scans, radiology reports, patient risk factors, and other clinical findings.
- **Overdiagnosis Risk:** The *Thoracic Cancer* study indicates that while AI enhances GGN detection in Asian populations, there's a risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment due to the high prevalence of indolent tumors, which can lead to unnecessary interventions and patient anxiety.
- **Specificity and Standardization:** The *Life (Basel)* review emphasizes that while AI boosts specificity in lung cancer screening to 85-90% with faster processing times, challenges remain in standardizing these approaches and integrating them into clinical practice.

#### BRONCHOSCOPY
**Narrow Band Imaging (NBI)** has higher sensitivity (80%), specificity (84%), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR 31.49%) than Autofluorescence Bronchoscopy (AFB) in detecting premalignant airway lesions.

#### CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS (CTCS)
**Circulating tumor cells (CTCs)** can be detected in early-stage lung cancer (I-IIIA), with detection rates as high as 62.5% for stage I and II using CellCollector, showing 71.6% similarities between CTCs and tumor tissues in gene mutation sites of TP53, FGFR1, HER2, PDGFRA and CFS1R.

#### EARLYCDT BLOOD TEST
The **Early Diagnosis of Lung Cancer Scotland (ECLS) trial**, involving 12208 high-risk patients, found that **EarlyCDT**, a blood test based on lung cancer autoantibodies, led to **41.1% of patients being diagnosed at early stages (stage I and II)** compared to 26.8% in the control group.

#### MEDIASTINAL STAGING
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** A 2010 study in Melbourne, Australia, found that initial evaluation of NSCLC with EBUS-TBNA (with surgical confirmation of negative results) was the most cost-beneficial approach at AU$2961, compared to mediastinoscopy at AU$8859. A 2022 cost-minimization analysis in Brazil found that EBUS-TBNA without surgical confirmation costs R$1,254/I$2,961 compared to mediastinoscopy at R$3,255/I$7,688.
- **Guidelines and Practice:** A 2025 review in *Annals of Surgical Oncology* states current guidelines recommend preoperative invasive mediastinal staging for most patients with potentially resectable lung cancer, except those with negative imaging and small peripheral tumors.
- **EBUS-TBNA and VAM:** A meta-analysis of 29 studies ending in November 2021 showed confirmatory VAM after negative EBUS-TBNA has 66.9% sensitivity and the combination has 96.7% sensitivity for mediastinal staging of NSCLC. A 2015 study (Ge et al.) reported EBUS-TBNA sensitivity of 83% and mediastinoscopy sensitivity of 86%; a 2011 study (Yasufuku et al.) showed similar sensitivities for EBUS-TBNA and VAM (81% and 79%, respectively) when performed simultaneously, but VAM sensitivity dropped to 60% when performed after negative EBUS-TBNA.
- **MEDIASTrial Results:** The MEDIASTrial, a randomized clinical trial published in 2023, found that EBUS alone is non-inferior to EBUS with confirmatory mediastinoscopy in patients with resectable NSCLC, with an 8.8% unforeseen N2 disease rate after immediate resection.

#### BIOPSY TECHNIQUES
- **Fine-Needle Aspiration:** A March 2024 review in *Molecular Oncology* supports **fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA)** as a less traumatic and more repeatable tumor sampling technique compared to core needle biopsy (CNB), potentially improving healthcare economics.

#### MINIMALLY INVASIVE TECHNIQUES FOR BREAST CANCER
- **Vacuum-Assisted Excision:** A May 2024 *British Journal of Radiology* article (Mactier, McIntosh, Sharma) suggests **minimally invasive techniques like vacuum-assisted excision (VAE), cryoablation, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA)** may reduce treatment burden for early, good prognosis breast cancers, with the UK SMALL trial assessing VAE versus open surgery. The SMALL trial, a phase III randomized multicentre trial in the UK, compares vacuum-assisted excision (VAE) to open surgery for small, screen-detected, biologically favorable invasive breast cancer, using coprimary endpoints of surgical re-excision rates and local recurrence at 5 years post-VAE, registered under ISRCTN12240119.
- **Axillary Disease Treatment:** A May 2024 review in the *British Journal of Radiology* cites the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, which found that low-burden axillary disease can be treated with systemic therapy, avoiding completion axillary dissection without adversely impacting breast cancer mortality. The ACOSOG Z0011 trial demonstrated that among women with T1 or T2 invasive primary breast cancer, no palpable axillary adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases, 10-year overall survival for patients treated with sentinel lymph node dissection alone was noninferior to overall survival for those treated with axillary lymph node dissection (86.3% vs 83.6%, respectively).
- **Cryoablation and VAE:** A 2021 review indicates cryoablation and VAE are FDA-approved for fibroadenomas, and the American Society of Breast Surgeons includes them in treatment algorithms; promising clinical studies exist for RFA and cryoablation in early-stage breast cancer, but decisions should be case-specific. The Cryoablation of Small Breast Tumors in Early Stage Breast Cancer (FROST; NCT01992250) and Cryoablation of Low Risk Small Breast Cancer (Ice3; NCT02200705) clinical trials are using US-guided biopsy at 6 months post-cryoablation to evaluate residual viable tumor, with short-term results showing a 99% success rate.

#### DE-ESCALATION TRIALS AND STRATEGIES
- **Duplication of Research:** A systematic review of 97 locoregional therapy de-escalation trials (48 RCTs, 49 cohorts) with 94,866 participants reveals significant duplication of research, with many studies addressing similar questions, especially in low-risk patients; 73.2% of studies focus on patients having primary surgery, commonly omitting surgery or radiotherapy.
- **Biomarker Stratification and Patient Involvement:** A systematic review highlights that less than 10% of breast cancer de-escalation trials use biomarker stratification, and only 6.2% explicitly involve patient advocates in study design, indicating a lack of patient focus and a need for more efficient, collaborative, and innovative trial designs.
- **Observation vs. SLNB:** In post-menopausal women with cT1-T2 N0, HR+/HER2− breast cancer and negative axillary ultrasound (AUS), **observation is superior to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) regarding cost-effectiveness**; observation resulted in a Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) of $655,659 vs $641,778 for SLNB.
- **SLNB Cost-Effectiveness:** A cost-effectiveness analysis showed that routine SLNB in women > 70 years old with hormone-receptor positive, clinically node-negative, operable breast cancer is not cost-effective from the payer or societal perspectives, with an ICER of $138,374/LY and $131,900/LY, respectively; observation provided more QALYs (10.53) than SLNB (10.33) at a lower cost.
- **ALND Reduction:** A systematic review of trends in axillary clearance after the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, encompassing 290,754 women across nine countries, indicated a significant decrease in axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) rates, ranging from a 5.6% to 73.4% reduction; this highlights the trial's practice-changing impact but also identifies variability and the need for more global research.
- **INSEMA Trial:** The INSEMA trial demonstrated a negative predictive value of 98.4% for ≥3 positive lymph nodes in 755 cT1–2 N0 women with negative AUS undergoing SLNB, supporting observation as a potentially superior approach to SLNB in AUS-negative patients.

#### MULTI-CANCER EARLY DETECTION (MCED) TESTS
- **Value Proposition:** A survey of US healthcare providers (HCPs), payers, and patients indicates broad agreement on the value proposition of **blood-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests**, but limited use due to perceived lack of clinical accuracy and utility data, high out-of-pocket patient costs, and lack of payer coverage.
- **Accessibility and Equity:** Marginalized populations experience worse cancer-related outcomes, and multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests may reduce access barriers if designed to address structural, systematic, and personal barriers, including affordability and trust. Optical technologies are being developed and evaluated as immediate and accurate triage tests for cervical cancer, including low-cost, handheld colposcopes, high-resolution optical imaging systems, and multi-modal optical imaging systems. A mobile phone-based VIA approach with expert mentoring improved the reliability and reproducibility of VIA, with false positive rates decreasing further with the provision of training and mentoring, decreasing the burden on downstream provision of diagnostic and treatment services.
- **WHO Goals:** The WHO's Global Action Plan on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) targets 80% availability of affordable services for cancer prevention, early detection, timely treatment, and palliative care by 2030.

### CONCLUSION
**Early-stage diagnosis of breast and lung cancer is rapidly evolving.** Advances in imaging technologies, AI integration, liquid biopsies, and minimally invasive techniques offer the potential to improve detection rates, reduce treatment burden, and enhance patient outcomes. However, challenges remain in standardizing AI approaches, ensuring equitable access to advanced diagnostics, addressing the risk of overdiagnosis, and improving the cost-effectiveness of screening programs. Future research should focus on refining these technologies, validating their clinical utility, and integrating them into routine clinical practice to achieve the goal of diagnosing cancer at its earliest, most treatable stages. Furthermore, enhanced focus on patient-centric trial design, wider biomarker stratification and increased involvement of patient advocacy groups are needed to develop more efficient and innovative approaches to breast cancer detection and treatment.
